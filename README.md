This application for learning foreign languages.
The main idea of the application is learning words or phrases (tests). Tests are united by a common theme and belong to one block.
The interface functionality allows the administrator to create tests and blocks.
A registration form was also created. Before sending the form is validated by the login, password and e-mail fields. The login field is checked for uniqueness, a restriction on the upper and lower limit of characters. Login can consist of Latin characters spaces and numbers.
